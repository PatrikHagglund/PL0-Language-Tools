# PL/0 Language Tools

The PL/0 Language Tools serve as an example of how to construct a
compiler. The language [PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0) was
originally introduced in the book "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs",
by Niklaus Wirth in 1975.

![Overview](Overview.png)

This project includes a full stack of tools designed for educational
purposes to learn about compilers, interpreters and virtual machines.
Each component can be executed independently and is typically between
100-300 lines of code.

It is designed to be clear and concise at the expense of performance. It
is easy to extend and modify, e.g. adding new syntax constructs or
machine instructions.

## Installation

Install ply:

	sudo easy_install ply

Then, simply download the files `pl0_*.py` and run them.

## Basic Usage

Here is a full example using the interpreter:

	$ ./pl0_interpreter.py < examples/fibonacci.pl0
	1
	1
	2
	3
	5
	8
	13
	21
	34
	55
	89
	144
	233
	377
	610
	987
	1597
	2584
	4181
	6765
	10946
	-- Stack Frame --
	Constants: {'K': 20}
	Variables: {'count': 21, 'k': 17711, 'm': 17711, 'n': 28657}
	Procedures: {}

Example of using the compiler, assembler and virtual machine:

	$ ./pl0_compiler.py < examples/fibonacci.pl0 | ./pl0_assembler.py | ./pl0_machine.py
	1
	1

	987
	1597
	2584
	4181
	6765
	10946
	-- Machine State --
	Sequence: [16, 6, 17711, 28657, 17711, 21, 10, 1, 7, 2, 10, 1, 7, 3, 10, 1, 7, 4, 10, 0, 7, 5, 6, 5, 10, 20, 31, 22, 57, 6, 4, 50, 11, 6, 3, 7, 4, 6, 2, 6, 3, 45, 7, 3, 6, 4, 7, 2, 6, 5, 10, 1, 45, 7, 5, 16, 22, 1]
	Stack: []
	Offset: -1

If you want to see a abstract syntax tree of your program, use the pl0_graphviz.py command:

	./pl0_graphviz.py < examples/fibonacci.pl0

A sample graph is included in the `examples` directory.

For more advanced usage, including documentation on individual components, please see the [online documentation](http://programming.dojo.net.nz/study/pl0-language-tools/index).

## Cross Compiling

Recent development adds several new compiler targets. I'm interested in the possibility of cross compiling PL/0 to other languages; most of my work on this targets this.

I (Charles) am working on cross compilers for several stack based languages, including Retro, Parable, and ANS FORTH.
